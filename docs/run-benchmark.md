# Overview

This section contains the instructions to reproduce the micro-benchmarks of MicroView on IPU as described in Section 6.2 of the paper.

## Prerequisites
Make sure to follow the [Getting Started](README.md#-getting-started) guide to verify the setup is working correctly and basic functionalities of MicroView, including access to the IPU instance.

## Run the microbenchmarks (~10h)

An automation script will run `wrk` benchmarks with/without the Prometheus endpoint, varying the number of metrics and pods, and the classification model (threshold or ML-based).

### From host machine `mcnode28` via `tmux`

You run the experiments from `mcnode28`. This is the machine connected to the BlueField2 IPU.
Re-running the benchmarks should take around 10 hours of compute time. 

#### Using `tmux` (recommended)
Because the experiments take a long time to run, we recommend using `tmux` to avoid losing progress. You can detach from the `tmux` session with `Ctrl+b d` and re-attach later with `tmux attach -t uview`.

```bash
tmux new -t uview
conda activate uview
python tests/benchmarks/tput.py -o ./results/nsdi-aec
```

#### Example output

```
(uview) aec-nsdi-1@mcbf28$ python tests/benchmarks/tput.py -o ./results/aec-nsdi

### Edit experiment settings
Should you tweak any parameters, you can edit directly the variables in the script `tests/benchmarks/tput.py`.
The script is a quick and dirty experiment runner which exports env variables then read by `run.sh` to start the distributed system. You can check the code for more details.

## Plot Fig.5 (~5 minutes)
Once the experiments have finished:
* Double-check that environment variables defined in `plot/run.sh` are correct and point to the right `uview` directories both in `mcnode28` and `mcbf28`.
* Run the plotting script:

```bash
cd plot
./run.sh
```

#### Expected output

The script will:
* download the measurement taken in the IPU to local path (default is `results/aec-nsdi/`)
* plot figure 5a and 5b as `tput_vs_metrics.png` and `tput_vs_pods.png` in the same directory under `figures`

You can change the output directories by setting the `LOCAL_PATH` environment variable in `run.sh`.
